ARDEN syntax-based decision support systems are widely in use. Since this syntax<br>
became an ANSI standard, it was embraced by several medical information system<br>
vendors to provide decision support capabilities. Vendors who have developed ARDEN<br>
compliant applications include: Cerner Corporation, Healthvision, McKesson, SMS, and<br>
Micromedex.<br><hr>

        Asbru is a knowledge representation language to capture the clinical guideline and<br>
protocols as time oriented skeletal plans. The development of Asbru was part of the<br>
Asgaard project developed by the Technical University of Vienna, Stanford Medical<br>
Informatics, University of Newcastle, and University of Vienna. The goal of the Asgaard<br>
project is to develop task specific problem solving methods that perform medical decision<br>
support and critiquing tasks (Seyfang, Miksch, & Marcos, 2002).<br>
Asbru is a difficult language to be understood by a physician and hence a graphical<br>
knowledge acquisition tool is used to gather the knowledge or guideline and then output<br>
that into Asbru syntax behind the scenes for computer interpretation. The graphical tool<br>
used is called Protégé. The Asbru output created by Protégé can be shared with other<br>
medical decision support systems that are compliant with Asbru format.<br>

EON is a clinical guideline modeling system developed by Stanford University for<br>
creating guideline-based decision modules. The EON guideline model system was<br>
developed to address the problem of modeling clinical guidelines and protocols to<br>
provide patient specific decision support. This modeling system allows creating a<br>
knowledge engineering environment for easy encoding of clinical guidelines and<br>
protocols. EON guideline model allows association of conditional goals with guidelines.<br>
It provides three criteria languages to allow the medical practitioners to use and express<br>
their decision making complexities: a simple object oriented language that medical<br>
practitioners can use to encode the decision criteria, a temporal query type language, and<br>
a predicate logic.<br>
EON also uses Protégé as the medical knowledge acquisition tool to help medical<br>
practitioners provide medical decision criteria. The EON language is generated at the<br>
back end by the Protégé tool. This code is platform independent and can be shared<br>
between decision support systems that are EON compliant.<br>
EON is widely used in European countries and one of the major decision support system<br>
that uses EON is PRODIGY. The decision support system ATHENA, which provides<br>
hypertension related advices, also uses the EON guideline model as its decision support<br>
architecture.<br>

   GEM, an XML- (Extensible Markup Language) based guideline document model was<br>
introduced in 2000 by Yale center of medical informatics. This initiative is intended to<br>
facilitate the translation of medical guideline documents to a standard computer inter-<br>pretable format. The key difference between the other techniques and GEM is that it uses<br>
the industry standard XML for knowledge transfer purposes. GEM’s XML hierarchy is<br>

developer, intended audience, target population, method of development, testing,<br>
review plan, and knowledge components (Shiffman, Karras, Agrawal, Chen, Marenco, &<br>
Nath, 2000). Several of these branches appear identical to the slots of ARDEN syntax.<br>
While the goal of all of these knowledge transfer techniques is the same, they differ in<br>
their implementation strategies.<br>
The strength of this model is that it encodes both the recommendations and adequate<br>
information about the guideline recommendations, including its reason and quality of<br>
evidence (Shiffman et al., 2000). GEM was accepted as an ASTM standard in 2002.<br>
Knowledge extraction in GEM is a simple document markup rather than a programming<br>
task. GEM uses a knowledge acquisition tool called GEM Cutter to interactively gather<br>
he knowledge data and store it in a XML format.<br>

        GLARE is a medical domain independent guideline model system for acquiring, repre-<br>senting, and executing clinical guidelines. GLARE was introduced in 1997 by the<br>
Dipartimento di Informatica, Universita del Piemonto Orientale , Alexandria, Italy. This<br>
system boasts a modular architecture with acquisition and execution modules. The<br>
GLARE Knowledge representation language is designed to satisfy both the complexity<br>
and expressive rules. The format is limited but focused set of primitives. It consists of<br>
plans and atomic actions that can be queries, decisions, work actions, and conclusions<br>
(Open Clinical-Glare, 2004).<br>
GLARE knowledge acquisition system is an easy to use graphical user interface with<br>
syntactic and semantic verifications to check the formulated guidelines. Artificial<br>
intelligence temporal reasoning techniques are applied to weed out inconsistencies. The<br>
GLARE system goes one step ahead and also incorporates a decision support system<br>
for knowledge execution purposes. GLARE system has been tested for applicability in<br>
medical domains like bladder cancer, reflux esophagitis, and heart failure at the Laboratorio<br>
di Informatica Clinica, Torino, Italy. The commercial version of this product is still under<br>
development.<br></div>

       While medical decision support systems have been around for the past four decades, its<br>
usage among clinicians is still questionable. Several variables play a role in a success of<br>
a medical decision support system and it is important to address these to move ahead<br>
from where we stand now. Issues like physician reluctance, intimidating systems,<br>
proprietary interests, local practice, technological factors, and outdated knowledgebase<br>
are all limiting factors for the growth and acceptance of computer-based decision support<br>
</div><hr>
        <div class="p1">
systems. In addition to these limitations, the decision making functions are no longer<br>
limited to the physicians. The patients, healthcare administrators, insurance carriers,<br>
healthcare professionals, policy makers, risk analysts, and the government at large are<br>
all stakeholders in this medical decision making process. It will be extremely limiting to<br>
tie down these requirements to local proprietary computer systems.<br>
While the field of medicine pioneered the knowledge sharing techniques among decision<br>
support systems, the introduction of several sharing standards segmented market as a<br>
net result defeated the purpose of such standard. The growth, availability, and acces-<br>sibility of the Internet opened the door for development of a new model for sharing<br>
medical knowledge and decision support systems across networks. Internet-based<br>
decision support systems with focus on a particular medical domain will be prevalent in<br>
the future.<br>
The various knowledge sharing standards are naturally meeting a common merger. For<br>
example, several medical guideline modeling languages are using a common interface for<br>
knowledge acquisition purposes. Protégé is the most commonly used tool to acquire the<br>
knowledge and then formulate the output in various modeling languages. This converg-<br>ing trend will begin to happen at the knowledge representation and knowledge execution<br>
modules as well. This will give raise to a true acceptance of a common knowledge sharing<br>
technique.<br>
The next key area of medical decision support systems is the unique characteristics of<br>
its users. Great medical decision support systems when seldom used solves no purpose.<br>
Most users get intimidated by the complexities and challenges posed by the user<br>
interface. While medical decision making is not a simple process, the decision support<br>
systems should help reducing the complexity and not increasing them. Past studies<br>
indicate that the complexity of customizing the knowledge or a simple rule forces the<br>
physicians to refrain form using the system. Training clinicians in usage of complex<br>
decision support process is a worthy investment. The benefits of the usage of medical<br>
decision support systems outweigh the costs incurred in development, implementation,<br>
and maintenance of such products.<br>

            Medical decision support systems, when used along with the clinical information<br>
systems at the point of care can improve the quality of care provided. Despite evidence<br>
of the benefits of decision support, and despite endorsement by a national patient safety<br>
panel (Kohn, Corrigan & Donaldson, 2000), computerized clinical decision support has<br>
not achieved wide diffusion. A recent survey found that such systems were used in less<br>
than five percent of all healthcare facilities (Wong, Legnini, Whitmore, & Taylor, 2000).<br>
When the user interface, availability, and accessibility issues of the medical decision<br>
support systems are properly addressed, the usage of the systems will grow multi fold!<br>
When such medical decision support systems are blended into the day-to-day practice<br>
workflow, then these systems are destined to succeed!<br>
